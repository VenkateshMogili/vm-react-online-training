1.Clone repository - `git clone https://github.com/VenkateshMogili/vm-react-online-training.git`
2.`cd vm-react-online-training`
3.Run `npm install` command to install all the dependencies. (Only one time is enough)


To practice every session, follow these steps:
1.Change directory to session (e.g. `cd day1/session1`)
2.Run `npm run sync` command to synchronize the node modules.
3.Run `npm start` command to start the development server.
4.Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the app running.


Note: This process makes the development faster while learning, without creating multiple projects with duplicate node_modules.
